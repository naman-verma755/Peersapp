## Introduction

This is a web application where users can do programming with their friends with live changes in their codepad.
For building this web application we used React.js for front-end development, and Expresss.js and Node.js for back-end development. We are also using Socket.io which is  a javascript library that enables realtime, bidirectional communication between web-clients and servers.

## User's guide
When we visit home page of Peersapp we have two choices that are create room or join room. If we will click on create room, we can create a room and also set password for that room. For joining that room others have to click on join room and after then, they have to fill name and password (that set by the first user) of that room. You can invite all your interested peers for programming. After submitting required information, we have a *codepad* on our right side where users can write code and after typing **enter**, the changes in codepad were also visible to all other connected users also. Instant room and instant changes in codepad were increase the interests of users in programming. And along with that, on left side we also see a chat application where user also communicate with each other by sharing their thoughts and views.
