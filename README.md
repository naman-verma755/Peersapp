## Introduction

This is a Fullstack web application that not only enable users to compile their code in multiple programming languages but also enable them to code live with their peers on a sync codepad.Used Socket.io to implement chat application to enable Peers to communicate with each other.
For building this web application we used React.js for front-end development, and Expresss.js and Node.js for back-end development.

## User's guide
When we visit home page of Peersapp we have two choices either we go to code and compile our code or we go for Peers programming. If we click on Peers programming if have two options that are create room or join room. If we will click on create room, we can create a room and also set password for that room. For joining that room others have to click on join room and after then, they have to fill name and password (that set by the first user) of that room. You can invite all your interested peers for programming. After submitting required information, we have a *codepad* on our right side where users can write code and after typing **enter**, the changes in codepad were also visible to all other connected users also. And along with that, on left side we also see a chat application where user also communicate with each other by sharing their thoughts and views.
